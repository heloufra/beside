Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage


We noticed that your app requests the user’s consent to access their location but does not clarify the use of the location in the applicable purpose string.

Specifically, the location modal needs to indicate why they are accessing the location feature.

Next Steps

Please revise the relevant purpose string in your app’s Info.plist file to specify why the app is requesting access to the user's location. You can modify your app's Info.plist file using the property list editor in Xcode.

To help users understand why your app is requesting access to their personal data, all permission request alerts in your app should specify how your app will use the requested feature.

For additional information and instructions on requesting permission, please review the Requesting Permission section of the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and the Information Property List Key Reference.
